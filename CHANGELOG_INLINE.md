# Inline CSS Migration Log

Approach: B (inline base styles; keep a minimal scoped CSS for hover, media queries, and keyframes)

Summary
- Converted key layout/typography/spacing styles to inline styles.
- Preserved interactive behaviors (hover/focus/disabled), responsive rules (@media), and animations (@keyframes) in the existing <style scoped> sections to avoid regressions.

Files updated
1) src/views/LoginView.vue
   - Replaced outer wrappers with inline styles:
     - .login-page -> inline background gradient, positioning, overflow
     - .background-overlay, .electric-patterns -> inline positioning and sizing
     - .login-container, .login-brand, .login-form-section -> inline flex layout, paddings, backgrounds
   - Branding block:
     - .brand-content, .logo-section, .brand-logo, .brand-title, .brand-subtitle -> converted to inline
     - .features-list and each .feature-item/.feature-icon -> converted base to inline; hover remains in CSS
   - Form block:
     - Header (title/subtitle) -> inline
     - Inputs (labels and inputs) -> inline base styles; focus/disabled retained in CSS
     - Primary submit and Google button -> inline base; hover retained in CSS
   - Background floating patterns (.pattern-1/2/3) -> inline sizes/positions; keyframe animation kept

2) src/views/RegisterView.vue
   - Mirrored the same refactor pattern as LoginView:
     - Converted outer backgrounds/containers to inline
     - Branding block + features list -> inline base; hover in CSS
     - Form header/inputs/buttons -> inline base; focus/disabled/hover in CSS
     - Background floating patterns -> inline sizes/positions; keyframe animation kept

What remains in CSS (on purpose)
- Pseudo-classes: :hover, :focus, :disabled for buttons and inputs
- Animations: @keyframes float, spin
- Responsive: @media blocks for mobile/tablet layout

3) src/views/SavartHomepage.vue
   - Hero banner (desktop): inline base for container, background layers, hero text, CTA button, visual image block, and floating cards (positions, shadows). Hover/animations remain in CSS.
   - Features section: inline grid, card base, icon container; hover sheen and transforms remain in CSS.
   - Video section: inline layout, headings, paragraph, CTA button base; keep hover + shadow + responsive in CSS.
   - CTA section: inline base styles for background gradient, content spacing, buttons; retain hover effects and responsiveness in CSS.

4) src/views/DashboardView.vue
   - Wrapper/header/content: inline spacing, typography, colors.
   - Stats grid and cards: inline grid layout, card base (padding, radius, shadow), titles and numbers.
   - Quick actions: inline button base styles for primary/secondary/outline; keep hover/disabled in CSS.
   - Recent activity: inline list container, item layout, icon, and text styles.

5) src/views/ServicesView.vue
   - Inline page background, container, header.
   - Inline services grid and service cards (icon container, titles, descriptions) using theme variables.
   - Keep hover elevation and responsive grid in CSS.

6) Customer views
   - BookingView.vue: inline header, step indicator, vehicle grid/cards, service categories/items, center/date filters, time slots, summary sections, and step actions. Kept hover/select/focus/responsive in CSS.
   - MaintenanceHistoryView.vue: inline summary stats, records timeline (date circle, content/header/meta/status/cost), details sections, next-maintenance note, actions; kept responsive.
   - MyVehiclesView.vue: inline wrapper/header/grid/card base, vehicle details; modal base retained inline-ready, animations/responsive kept in CSS.

7) Technician views
   - ChecklistsView.vue: inline wrapper/container/typography per theme.
   - PartsRequestView.vue: inline wrapper/container/typography per theme.
   - WorkQueueView.vue: inline wrapper/container/typography per theme.

8) Staff views
   - AppointmentsView.vue: inline header, control panel (filters + quick stats), appointments grid, card base, time panel, status badges; kept hover/responsive.
   - CustomersView.vue: inline base wrapper/container/heading/description (ready for detailed content).
   - ServiceOrdersView.vue: base structure prepared; inline wrapper/container/heading/description to be completed alongside detailed layout.

9) Admin views
   - PartsManagementView.vue: inline base wrapper/container/heading/description.
   - ReportsView.vue: inline base wrapper/container/heading/description.
   - StaffManagementView.vue: inline base wrapper/container/heading/description.

Next steps
- Optional: CSS cleanup to remove base rules already moved inline, keeping only hover, focus, @media, and @keyframes.
- Continue inlining any newly added view content following the same theme variables.

Notes
- Inline styles use camelCase when bound via :style objects in Vue; standard kebab-case is used in literal style="..." attributes.
- Inline styles have high specificity and can override component-scoped rules; retained CSS uses :hover and @media only to avoid conflicts.
